1. **Save this template to your computer.** Save this word template in the following path on your computer: ```C:\Users\<your login name>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Templates```. Remember to replace \<your login name\>  with your username.
2. **Create a new document from this template.** There are two ways to create a new doc from this template
   1. Find the saved template in your computer, double click it.
   2. If you open the MS Word app and click 'new', you will find this template in the 'Personal' library. Click this template to create a new document, and save this document to where your want to save this document
3. **Change the template of an existing template if needed.** Assume you are editing a word doc using another template, and you want to switch to this one. In this existing word doc, click File, click Options, click Add-ins, choose 'Templates' in the 'Manage:', click 'Go', and then click 'OK'. Then you can choose a new template, and click 'Attach' and then click 'OK'.
4. **Add a caption of a table.** Right click the table, choose ‘Insert Caption’, and choose ‘Table’ and ‘Above Selected Item’. 
5. **Add a caption of a figure.** Right click the figure, choose ‘Insert Caption’, and choose ‘Figure’ and ‘Below Selected Item’. 
6. **Create a table from table templates.** There are two templates here, namely ‘SanXianBiao’ and ‘SanXianBiao_Simple’. The examples can be seen in the document. They are accessible in Insert -> Table -> Quick Tables.
7. **Cite a table (or figure).** Use Insert -> Cross-reference -> Choose ‘Table’ (or ‘Figure’) -> Choose ‘Only label and number’ -> Choose the item that you want to cite.
8. **Add a numbered equation.** Use Insert -> Table -> Quick Tables -> Table_Formula_Numbered. This will insert a column row table as shown in the document. Alternatively, you can copy and paste the example table below. 
9. **Cite an equation.** Use Insert -> Cross-reference -> Equation -> Entire caption. The cited style would be (#), with # representing the equation number. You need to type ‘Equation’ before the equation number.
